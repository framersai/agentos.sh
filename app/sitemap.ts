/**
 * The sitemap emits the canonical (bare-path, no locale prefix for the
 * default locale) URL per page, with `alternates.languages` pointing to
 * every locale variant. Earlier revisions emitted all 8 locales as
 * top-level sitemap entries; that produced 192 URLs, of which Google
 * Search Console flagged 333 as "Discovered – currently not indexed"
 * because the non-English translations are largely auto-translated UI
 * chrome wrapping the same English content, and Google decided
 * indexing them wasn't worth the crawl budget.
 *
 * The current strategy:
 *   - Sitemap emits the default-locale URL at the bare path (no
 *     `/en/` prefix), matching the `canonical()` helper's output.
 *     Google was already overriding the user-declared `/en/`
 *     canonical with the bare-path version anyway (~19 pages in the
 *     "Duplicate, Google chose different canonical" bucket).
 *   - `alternates.languages` still lists all 8 locales so Google
 *     knows the translations exist and can serve them to users in
 *     matching regions.
 *   - The locale-prefixed HTML files (`/en/`, `/es/`, …) still ship
 *     in the static export and remain reachable; Cloudflare 301s
 *     `/en/...` to the bare path so any inbound link to `/en/...`
 *     collapses into the canonical URL.
